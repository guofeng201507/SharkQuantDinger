# QuantDinger Documentation

QuantDinger is a self-hosted AI trading platform that connects market research,
Strategy API V2 development, backtesting, paper/live execution, operations, and
AI-agent access. This documentation describes the current v5 release.

[中文文档](../README_CN.md) · [Official website](https://quantdinger.com) ·

> Live trading can submit real orders. Start in paper mode, grant exchange keys
> the minimum permissions required, and confirm the legal and operational
> requirements for your jurisdiction. QuantDinger does not provide investment
> advice.

## Five-minute installation

Prerequisites: Docker with Compose v2. The installer asks for an administrator
account, generates the required secrets, writes the deployment environment, and
starts the prebuilt GHCR stack.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenByteInc/QuantDinger/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenByteInc/QuantDinger/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

After startup:

| Surface | Default local address |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop web app | `http://127.0.0.1:8888` |
| Mobile web app | `http://127.0.0.1:8889` |
| Backend health check | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health` |

For source builds, reverse proxies, HTTPS, upgrades, and proxy settings, use the
[cloud deployment guide](deployment/CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_EN.md).

## System map

The v5 runtime separates long-lived ownership from request handling:

| Process | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `migration` | Applies database schema changes before dependent services start. |
| `kafka-init` | Creates the versioned runtime topics before event consumers start. |
| `backend` | HTTP authentication, validation, queries, and durable command submission. |
| `trading-worker` | Control/realtime runtimes, broker sessions, fenced order execution, reconciliation, and grid actors. |
| `strategy-dispatcher-worker` | Converts closed bars into stable strategy-shard evaluation batches. |
| `strategy-evaluator-worker` | Hosts hot distributed bar runtimes and produces fenced order intents. |
| `kafka-audit-worker` | Audits the versioned runtime event stream. |
| `scheduler-worker` | Portfolio, deployment, payment, and notification schedules. |
| `celery-worker` | Finite retryable work such as AI jobs, backtests, reports, and maintenance. |
| `celery-beat` | Periodically enqueues Celery work. |

PostgreSQL is the system of record. `redis` is an evictable cache;
`redis-jobs` is the durable Celery broker/result tier, and Kafka is the ordered
runtime event backbone. See the
[architecture overview](architecture/README.md) before changing process
ownership or shared state.

## Language and maintenance policy

Each human-readable page uses one primary language. English and Chinese pages
are paired when both are maintained; the website language switch links directly
to the paired page. Machine-readable schemas, identifiers, environment variable
names, and code remain in their canonical English form.

The repository `docs/` directory is the source of truth. Update the relevant
index and counterpart language page when a contract or workflow changes. Do not
publish planning notes, completed roadmaps, or temporary audits as product
documentation.
