## Exchange-routed equity product contract
- Preserve the complete canonical instrument returned by product discovery, including leading zeros, quote or settlement currency, exchange, and market type. Examples are `Crypto:00700/HKD@gate:spot`, `Crypto:AAPL/USD@gate:spot`, and a catalog-confirmed Binance Hong Kong equity perpetual such as `Crypto:HK0700/USDT@binance:swap`.
- The `Crypto` prefix is the exchange-routing namespace; it does not assert that the underlying asset is cryptocurrency. The catalog distinguishes `direct_equity`, `tokenized_equity`, `stock_perpetual`, and ordinary `crypto` products and records an API family for execution.
- Current venue families are exact: Binance, OKX, and Bybit support `tokenized_equity/spot/spot` plus `stock_perpetual/swap/swap`; Bitget supports `tokenized_equity/spot/reality` plus `stock_perpetual/swap/swap`; Gate supports `direct_equity/spot/stock` plus `stock_perpetual/swap/swap`; HTX equity products remain disabled until authoritative product metadata and an execution contract are verified.
- Product identity and execution eligibility come from the active exchange product catalog. Do not infer a direct equity, tokenized equity, stock perpetual, venue, region, currency, or native instrument ID from ticker spelling alone, and do not manufacture catalog metadata in strategy source. When a venue does not expose authoritative equity metadata, keep the product unsupported rather than guessing.
- Gate Tencent uses `Crypto:00700/HKD@gate:spot` with `direct_equity/spot/stock` and maps to `HKStock:00700`; Gate Apple uses `Crypto:AAPL/USD@gate:spot` and maps to `USStock:AAPL`. Find them with exchange Gate, market type Spot, and product type Direct Equity, then select the exact returned product.
- A catalog-confirmed Binance Hong Kong equity perpetual such as `Crypto:HK0700/USDT@binance:swap` uses `stock_perpetual/swap/swap` and may map to `HKStock:00700`. It is a derivative settled under the venue contract, not direct ownership of the Hong Kong share. Do not rewrite it as Gate spot, `HKStock:00700.HK`, or a differently named Binance contract.
- Preserve the selected exchange instrument in `context.set_universe` and every data, position, and order reference. Never remove leading zeros, change quote currency, switch venue/API family, change `@spot` to `@swap`, or replace the execution instrument with its underlying stock identity.
- Exchange spot equities are long-only and must not call `context.allow_leverage`. Equity perpetuals follow the Crypto swap contract: declare direction metadata; omit `position_side` for `one_way` net positions and pass it for hedge-leg modes; permit leverage only with `context.allow_leverage(max_leverage=N)` when requested.
- For research, factor screening, or a traditional securities account, use `HKStock:00700.HK` or `USStock:AAPL`. These are separate execution identities and must not be silently converted into exchange orders. Conversely, an exchange-routed equity may use a catalog-confirmed `USStock` or `HKStock` underlying for historical bars and point-in-time fundamentals while retaining its exact exchange identity for execution.
- Fundamental access requires a valid catalog underlying identity and locally available point-in-time fields. Guard missing rows and fields; never guess a region or fundamental value. A dynamic pool intended for exchange execution must resolve to exact catalog products, not plain broker/research symbols.
- Keep one live strategy within a compatible venue, market type, API family, and capital currency. Do not combine HKD Gate direct equities with USD/USDT products in one allocation merely because their underlyings are equities.
- Strategy code must use Strategy API V2 data and order APIs. Do not call exchange stock endpoints, broker APIs, or public data providers directly. Compile or backtest success does not prove live eligibility; deployment revalidates the current catalog product, venue capability, account, trading status, sizing rules, and currency.

# Strategy API V2 contract

## Required structure
- Start with a triple-quoted docstring. Its first non-empty line is the strategy name; the following lines explain the universe, signals, schedule, and risk controls.
- Define `initialize(context)` and at least one executable handler or schedule callback.
- The strategy source owns the universe, market, instrument type, the exact data frequency or frequencies required by its logic, subscriptions, benchmark, schedules, and trading rules.
- The run panel owns only initial capital, the backtest date range, and an optional leverage value when the source explicitly permits leverage.

## Universe and market ownership
- Use canonical instruments such as `USStock:SPY`, `HKStock:00700.HK`, `CNStock:600519.SH`, `Crypto:BTC/USDT@binance:spot`, `Crypto:AAPL/USD@gate:spot`, `Crypto:00700/HKD@gate:spot`, and a catalog-confirmed exchange equity perpetual such as `Crypto:HK0700/USDT@binance:swap`.
- Exchange-listed equities keep the `Crypto` market prefix because execution uses the selected exchange credential. Preserve the exact venue, market type, currency, symbol, product type, and API family returned by product search; never rewrite the execution identity as a broker-listed `USStock` or `HKStock` instrument.
- An explicit venue is part of the instrument identity: `Crypto:SOL/USDT@binance:swap` is also a perpetual contract. Preserve the exchange and market-type suffix exactly.
- For a fixed universe call `context.set_universe([...])`.
- For a platform universe pool call `context.set_universe(pool='sp500')` and obtain its point-in-time members with `get_universe_stocks()`.
- For an index universe call `context.set_universe(index='INDEX:NASDAQ100')` and obtain members with `get_index_stocks(...)` when needed.
- Call `context.subscribe(frequency='1d', fields=[...])`. Single-timeframe is the default: emit exactly one subscription unless the user explicitly requests cross-timeframe confirmation or the supplied strategy logic already reads several timeframes. For an explicit multi-timeframe strategy, call it once for each required timeframe (at most eight), preserve every requested timeframe, and never collapse `1d + 4h + 1h` into one subscription. Do not ask the run panel for a symbol, market, exchange, or timeframe.
- Use `context.set_warmup(bars)` for indicator history and `context.set_benchmark(...)` when a benchmark is meaningful.
- Warmup is a data-loading requirement, not an automatic handler guard. Check available history and valid indicator values inside each executable handler.

## Event model
- CTA strategies implement `handle_data(context, data)`.
- Single-symbol signal strategies normally implement `handle_data(context, data)`. Do not add a schedule unless the user requests one or the strategy is explicitly a periodic portfolio rebalance.
- Portfolio strategies may register the global helpers `run_daily(callback, time="HH:MM")`, `run_weekly(callback, weekday=1, time="HH:MM")`, or `run_monthly(callback, monthday=1, time="HH:MM")` in `initialize` and rebalance inside the callback. These are runtime-bound global helpers; call them directly and never as `context.run_daily`, `context.run_weekly`, or `context.run_monthly`.
- Keep essential cross-mode trading logic in `handle_data` or explicit scheduled callbacks. The backtest invokes `before_trading_start` and `after_trading_end` on each driving bar; the live session invokes `before_trading_start` on a new date and does not dispatch `after_trading_end`. Do not rely on these names as identical daily hooks in both modes.
- Store per-run state on the global `g` namespace.
- In `handle_data`, use `context.current_dt` to identify the current completed bar by its opening timestamp. In a live scheduled callback it is the scheduler clock instead, so use the returned history index to identify a signal bar. For cooldowns and holding periods, advance a counter on `g` once per distinct completed bar. Never use `len(bars)`, `len(closes)`, or a rolling history window's row offset as a bar clock: the window length stops advancing when full and can permanently block re-entry.
- Confirm decisions from visible completed data only. Never read future rows, use negative shifts, or otherwise introduce look-ahead bias.
- `initialize` runs during manifest discovery. Use it only for declarations and initial `g` values; never request market data, read live positions, or place orders there.
- In backtests, scheduled callbacks see previous completed data and may submit for the current open; `handle_data` sees the newly completed bar and its market orders become eligible at the next available bar open. Limit orders and market restrictions may defer or prevent fills. In live sessions, callbacks read the latest completed data and enqueue asynchronous orders; never assume an exact opening-price fill or immediate position update.

## Parameters and metadata
- Declare tunable strategy knobs with `# @param <name> <int|float|bool|str> <default> <description>` and keep every declared default identical to the fallback used in code.
- Read run-supplied values only inside executable handlers or scheduled callbacks with `context.params.get("name", same_default)`. The discovery context used by `initialize(context)` has no `params`; never read `context.params` in `initialize`.
- Parameters may control signal periods, thresholds, target weights, stops, take profit, trailing protection, cooldowns, and bounded layer counts.
- Do not disguise universe, symbol, market type, frequency, leverage permission, initial capital, date range, commission, or slippage as ordinary strategy parameters.
- Use `context.set_metadata(...)` in `initialize` for stable descriptive metadata such as direction mode and strategy family, passing keyword arguments such as `context.set_metadata(direction_mode="long_only", strategy_family="trend")`. Metadata is not a substitute for executable risk logic.
- `direction_mode` accepts exactly `long_only`, `short_only`, `one_way`, `both`, or `neutral`. Use `one_way` for a single signed/net position that may reverse between long and short. Use `both` only for independent hedge-mode long and short legs that may coexist.
- Keep direction metadata consistent with executable order behavior. A `one_way` strategy omits `position_side` and closes the current net position before opening the opposite direction. A `both` strategy uses explicit long/short legs; changing only metadata never creates either behavior.

## Data and factors
- Historical-bar signatures are exact: `get_history(count, frequency=None, field=None, security_list=None)` and the default form `data.history(symbols, count, fields=None)`. Multi-timeframe data views add the optional keyword `frequency=None` to `data.history`.
- `frequency` on `data.history` and `data.current` is keyword-only. `get_history` uses singular `field`; `data.history` uses plural `fields`.
- Read the current scalar field with `data.current(symbol, field="close")`; multi-timeframe code may add the optional keyword `frequency=None`. There is no `get_current_data` API and `data.current(...)` does not return an object with a `.close` attribute.
- In `get_history(...)`, `count` is always the first argument and must be an integer. In `data.history(...)`, symbols are first and the integer count is second. Prefer explicit keywords when using `data.history`, for example `data.history(symbol, count=60, fields=["close"])`.
- A history request for one symbol returns a pandas `DataFrame` directly. Use `bars["close"]`; never index the result again with `bars[symbol]`. Multiple-symbol requests return a dictionary keyed by canonical symbol.
- Never use a pandas DataFrame or Series directly as a boolean condition. Test `len(...)`, `.empty`, `.any()`, or `.all()` explicitly.
- Use `indicator(name, symbol, **params)`, `factor(name, symbol, **params)`, or `get_factors(symbols, names, **params)` for technical factors.
- TA-Lib functions are available through the adapter when TA-Lib is installed; its catalog readiness check requires at least 129 functions, not exactly 129. Use catalog names and parameter schemas, not an invented `ta` namespace or a direct `import talib`.
- `indicator` returns a Series or a multi-output DataFrame; `factor` returns one scalar. For MACD select `macd`, `macdsignal`, or `macdhist` from the returned frame; STOCH uses `slowk`/`slowd`, KDJ uses `k`/`d`/`j`. Do not assume `indicator(..., output=...)` universally reduces multi-output results to a Series. Use the active factor schema for scalar output choices.
- Use `get_fundamentals(fields, symbols)` only for real point-in-time fundamental fields supported by the platform. Do not invent fields or use future reports.
- `get_factors` and `get_fundamentals` return DataFrames indexed by canonical instrument with requested names/fields as columns. Guard empty frames, missing rows/columns, and NaN/None rather than inventing fallback fundamentals.
- Exchange-listed equities may use a catalog-confirmed underlying `USStock` or `HKStock` identity for point-in-time fundamentals while retaining their exchange product identity for orders. Missing or unknown underlying identities remain unavailable; never guess the market from a display name.
- Use `get_index_stocks(reference)` for dynamic index constituents.
- Use `get_universe_stocks()` for the currently selected platform universe pool. Do not copy pool constituents into source code.
- Native strategy timeframes are exactly `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, and `1w`. Use these lowercase canonical literals in generated source. `1w` is weekly; monthly bars are not part of the current strategy contract.
- Every frequency requested by `get_history`, `data.history`, `data.current`, `indicator`, `factor`, or `get_factors` must be declared with `context.subscribe`. If the user explicitly requests `1d + 4h + 1h`, the strategy therefore has three subscribe calls and three explicit history reads.
- The fastest subscribed timeframe drives `handle_data`. Higher-timeframe bars remain invisible until their own close; never emulate them by resampling visible lower bars or by reading an unfinished candle.
- Guard the history length of every timeframe independently. Size `context.set_warmup(...)` for the largest required lookback, while retaining a separate `len(...)` guard for every returned frame.
- Only when cross-timeframe confirmation is explicitly requested, use the completed higher timeframe as the requested regime, trend, or crossover confirmation and the fastest timeframe as the execution clock. Preserve whether the request means higher-timeframe bullish alignment (`fast > slow`) or a fresh higher-timeframe crossover event; do not silently substitute one meaning for the other. Make low-timeframe order conditions idempotent so a persistent higher-timeframe state does not cause repeated scale-ins.
- Do not invent or subscribe to extra confirmation timeframes. A request naming one timeframe must remain single-timeframe. Conversely, do not silently replace an unavailable requested timeframe with a different one; generated code must compile against the exact source-owned subscriptions.

## Orders and positions
- Order-helper signatures are exact: `order(symbol, amount)`, `order_value(symbol, value)`, `order_target(symbol, amount)`, `order_target_value(symbol, value)`, and `order_target_percent(symbol, percent)`.
- These are runtime-bound global helpers. Never pass `context` as their first argument. Optional execution and protection values must be keyword arguments after the two required arguments.
- `get_position(symbol)` returns a `Position` object; swap code adds the optional keyword `position_side`. Read `position.amount`, `position.avg_cost`, and `position.last_price` directly; never use dictionary membership, subscripting, `.get(...)`, or `getattr(...)` on it.
- A `Position` has no `.quantity` or `.cost_basis`; use `.amount` and `.avg_cost`.
- Use `get_positions(...)` when a dictionary of multiple positions is required.
- A string argument to `get_position` returns a Position even when flat (`amount == 0`); omitted or iterable symbols return a dictionary. For hedged positions, `get_positions()` keys include `::long`/`::short`; read one leg with `get_position(symbol, position_side=...)`.
- `order` and `order_value` specify changes; `order_target`, `order_target_value`, and `order_target_percent` specify final targets. Quantity APIs use units without an additional leverage multiplier. Value and percent APIs apply the runtime leverage to the requested capital budget or equity fraction; do not multiply leverage into them again. Keep sizing bounded by available capital and explicit allocation rules.
- An order helper returns an order reference only when the call supplies a non-empty `client_order_id`; otherwise it returns `None` even though an intent was queued. Never use return truthiness as a fill test. Track explicit references with `get_order_status(reference)["status"]`; cancellation can remain `cancel_pending` in live mode.
- Keep long entry, long exit, short entry, and short exit conditions independent. A bearish long exit is not automatically a short entry.
- Give every order a stable, non-empty `reason` for auditability.
- Spot and all non-crypto markets are long-only for now.

## Contract leverage
- Leverage is supported only when every source-controlled instrument is a Crypto perpetual contract ending in `@swap`.
- A leveraged strategy must explicitly call `context.allow_leverage(max_leverage=N)` in `initialize`.
- The user may then choose a leverage value from 1 through the declared maximum in backtest or live setup.
- Never call `allow_leverage` for stocks, ETFs, futures outside the Crypto market, index universes, or Crypto spot.
- Do not hardcode the user's selected leverage inside order logic; the runtime applies the chosen leverage.

## Safety
- Bound loops and position sizes. Add explicit limits to pyramiding, grids, DCA, and martingale behavior.
- Do not use file, network, database, process, reflection, dynamic execution, or unsafe import APIs.
- Do not use `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `getattr`, `setattr`, dunder access, or unsafe imports.

- Enforce exact history signatures: `get_history(count, frequency, field, security_list)` and `data.history(symbols, count, fields=None, *, frequency=None)`. A single-symbol result is already a DataFrame.
- Preserve callback input types: `on_rebalance` gets a symbol-to-DataFrame dictionary, while scheduled callbacks and `handle_data` get a data view. Preserve the selected workspace type.

- Never add a new timeframe during repair unless it is explicitly requested or an existing history/factor read already requires it. Keep single-timeframe source single-timeframe.
- Canonicalize supported literals to `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, or `1w`; weekly is `1w` and monthly is unsupported.
- Repair undeclared literal reads by adding the matching subscription instead of rewriting every read to the driving timeframe. Do not collapse, resample, or otherwise erase requested higher-timeframe confirmation logic.

- Convert numpy arrays back to indexed pandas Series before calling pandas-only methods.
- Use English for identifiers, metadata, comments, parameter descriptions, and default display labels unless the user explicitly requests localized display labels.
- Return Python only, without markdown or explanations.
